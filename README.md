**Java Core Concepts & Data Structures

Arrays: Implemented static data structures for efficient storage and retrieval, supporting operations like searching, sorting, and multi-dimensional arrays.
Collection Framework: Worked with Java collections such as List, Set, and Map to manage dynamic data efficiently. Utilized ArrayList, HashSet, and HashMap for various use cases.
Generics: Applied type safety in collections and methods using generics, ensuring code reusability and preventing runtime errors.
Interfaces: Designed loosely coupled applications using Java interfaces, enabling abstraction and multiple inheritance.
Queue: Implemented queue-based data structures, including PriorityQueue and Deque, for task scheduling and order management.
Sorting Algorithms: Worked with sorting techniques like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Insertion Sort for optimizing data arrangements.
String Handling: Manipulated strings using String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer, performing operations like concatenation, searching, and pattern matching.
